* Naming Conventions:
	- lower_case_with_underscore - for functions, methods, attributes, variables.
   	- ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORE - for constants.
   	- MixedCase - for classes.
	- Mixed_Case_With_Underscore - for libs, packages.

* Commenting Conventions:
	- When commenting, put a space between the comment sign (#/'''/"""/etc.) and the actual comment.
	- In addition, if you put a comment directly after a line of code, seperate the code and the comment sign with another space.
	- For Example:
		# Main Work:
		l = list() # creat a new list.
	- Lines that are 'for the record' will be marked with a comment like so: # -For The Record-

* Other Conventions:
	- It's best to put a space before and after a sign as these '='/'=='/'!='/'>'/etc.
	- At the end of EVERY text file you MUST put our moto! (see the end of this file for the moto).


Keep that and the code will look good! :)

Exciting. Satisfying. Period.
